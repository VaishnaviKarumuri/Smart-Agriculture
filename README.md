# Smart-Agriculture
**Cultivating Tomorrow - A smart agriculture approach with IOT and Machine Learning:**
1. This IoT-based smart agriculture project employs machine learning algorithms to enhance decision-making in farming
practices, specifically focusing on binary and multi-class classifications.
2. The binary classification task is to predict the necessity of irrigation and provide farmers an impactful solution to precision
farming. The incorporation of the Tsetlin Machine for binary classification further enriches the predictive capabilities of the
system.
3. This classification approach also aids in recommending the most suitable crop for cultivation based on environmental
parameters.
4. The project extends its analysis to predictive modelling, utilizing Logistic Regression to estimate the duration of irrigation.
Leveraging Python's Seaborn library, the project generates informative plots such as heatmaps, scatterplots, and pie charts.
These visualizations serve as user-friendly tools for farmers to assess the irrigation requirements intuitively, enhancing the
interpretability and usability of the models.
